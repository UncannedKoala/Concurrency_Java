* A thread can be created in 2 ways: 
1>. Creating <Thread> class object and passing a <Runnable> object to <Thread> constructor. This <Runnable> object must have overridden the run() of <Runnable> interface. Then calling thread.start().
2>. Extending a Thread and overriding the run() of the Thread class, which is inherited && overridden by <Thread> from <Runnable>. Then calling thread.start();

* <Runnable> is Functional interface representing an operation that does not return a result, and its functional method is run();


* STATEs OF A THREAD:
• NEW : Thread state for a thread which has not yet started. 
• RUNNABLE: A thread in the runnable state is executing in the Java virtualmachine but it may be waiting for other resources from the operating systemsuch as processor. 
• BLOCKED: A thread in the blocked state is waiting for a monitor lock toenter a synchronized block/method or reenter a synchronized block/method aftercalling Object.wait. 
• WAITING: A thread in the waiting state is waiting for another thread toperform a particular action. 
• TIMED_WAITING: Thread state for a waiting thread with a specified waiting time. 
• TERMINATED: The thread has completed execution.
